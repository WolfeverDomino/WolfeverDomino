- 👋 Hi, I’m @WolfeverDomino
- 👀 I’m interested in most programming and technological related stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Electronics & Electrical Engineering in Singapore Polytechnic but also learning Python, C++, Microsoft Excel, Videography and LoRaWAN with TTN in my free time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on LoRaWAN nodes & gateway connection to the TTN. It's tough but we'll get through it.
